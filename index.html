The '''Whopper''' is the signature [[hamburger]] and an associated product line sold by the international [[fast food restaurant]] chain [[Burger King]] and its Australian franchise [[Hungry Jack's]]. Introduced in 1957, the hamburger has undergone several reformulations, including changes to portion size and bread used. The hamburger is well known in the fast food industry, with [[Burger King advertising]] itself as "the Home of the Whopper" and naming its kiosk stores the [[BK Whopper Bar]]. In response to the Whopper, Burger King's competitors have developed similar products designed to compete against it.

Burger King sells [[Whopper#Variants|several variants]] that are either seasonal or tailored to local tastes or customs. To promote the product, the restaurant occasionally releases limited-time variants. It is often at the center of advertising promotions, product [[tie-ins]], and corporate practical jokes and hoaxes.

==History==
The Whopper was created in 1957 by Burger King co-founder [[James McLamore]] and originally sold for 37 [[US cents]]<ref name="Smith 2012 p. 66">{{cite book | last=Smith | first=A.F. | title=Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat | publisher=ABC-CLIO | series=Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of what We Love to Eat | issue=v. 1 | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-313-39393-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-WcKK01H1cC&pg=PA66 | access-date=November 7, 2017 | page=66 | archive-date=April 9, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230409180013/https://books.google.com/books?id=7-WcKK01H1cC&pg=PA66 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="whopper">{{cite press release |url=http://bizjournals.bison.com/press/pr2-28-02bk.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019160640/http://bizjournals.bison.com/press/pr2-28-02bk.html |archive-date=19 October 2006 |title=Burger King Celebrates As The WHOPPER Turns 45 |author=BKC |publisher=BizJournals on Bison.com |date=8 February 2002 |access-date=22 October 2007}}</ref><ref name=Oss-37cents>{{cite web |last=Kent |first=Cindy |title=Monday Morning Quick Take |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-12-17/business/0712140402_1_burger-king-corp-whopper-ncci-holdings |work=Orlando Sun Sentinel |access-date=12 November 2013 |date=17 December 2013 |archive-date=12 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112085644/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-12-17/business/0712140402_1_burger-king-corp-whopper-ncci-holdings |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="BLS"/> (equivalent to US${{inflation|US|0.37|1957|r=2}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{Inflation/fn|US}} McLamore created the burger after he noticed that a rival restaurant in Gainesville, Florida was succeeding by selling a larger burger.<ref name="Bradford 2017">{{cite news |url=https://www.gainesville.com/news/20170513/gainesville-it-turns-out-is-actual-home-of-whopper |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519014740/https://www.gainesville.com/news/20170513/gainesville-it-turns-out-is-actual-home-of-whopper |archive-date=19 May 2017 |title=Gainesville, it turns out, is the actual 'home of the Whopper' |author=Bradford, Levi |publisher=Gainesville Sun on Gainesville.com |date=17 May 2017 |access-date=5 December 2018}}</ref> Believing that the success of the rival product was its size, he devised the Whopper, naming it so because he thought it conveyed ''"imagery of something big"''.<ref name=WP-History>{{cite news |last=Carman |first=Tim |title=The 55-cent Whopper and the evolution of burgers |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-we-can-eat/post/the-55-cent-whopper-and-the-evolution-of-burgers/2012/12/03/8dffc456-3d68-11e2-bca3-aadc9b7e29c5_blog.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=6 November 2013 |date=3 December 2013 |archive-date=23 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923022132/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-we-can-eat/post/the-55-cent-whopper-and-the-evolution-of-burgers/2012/12/03/8dffc456-3d68-11e2-bca3-aadc9b7e29c5_blog.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Major fast food chains did not release a similar product, until the McDonald's [[Quarter Pounder]] and the [[Burger Chef]] Big Shef in the early 1970s.<ref name=WP-History/><ref name="BI-Whopper v Big Bac">{{cite web |last=Lubin |first=Gus |title=For National Cheeseburger Day, Find Out What Sets A Big Mac And A Whopper Apart |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/big-mac-v-whopper-on-national-cheeseburger-day-2013-9 |work=Business Insider |access-date=6 November 2013 |date=18 September 2013 |archive-date=11 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111192613/http://www.businessinsider.com/big-mac-v-whopper-on-national-cheeseburger-day-2013-9 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="SHJ-Big Shef">{{cite news |title=Hardee's brings back the Big Shef |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=20070715&id=v0IfAAAAIBAJ&pg=1707,5287934 |access-date=6 November 2013 |newspaper=Spartensburg Herald-Journal |date=15 July 2007 |page=E5 |archive-date=12 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201212045336/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=20070715&id=v0IfAAAAIBAJ&pg=1707,5287934 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The packaging has undergone many changes since its inception.

The '''Whopper Jr.''' was created, by accident, in 1963 by Luis Arenas-Pérez (a.k.a. Luis Arenas), the only Latino in the Burger King Hall of Fame and president and CEO of Burger King in Puerto Rico.<ref name="Junior">{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/negocios/finanzas/nota/fallececreadordelwhopperjr-2009985/|title=Fallece creador del Whopper Jr.: Luis Arenas, quien presidió las operaciones de Burger King en Puerto Rico, murió esta semana.|first=Marian|last=Díaz|work=El Nuevo Dia|location=[[Guaynabo, Puerto Rico|Guaynabo]], [[Puerto Rico]]|language=es|date=20 February 2015|access-date=20 February 2015|archive-date=20 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220171744/http://www.elnuevodia.com/negocios/finanzas/nota/fallececreadordelwhopperjr-2009985/|url-status=live}}</ref> Upon the opening of the first Burger King restaurant in [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]], the molds for the (standard) Whopper buns had not yet arrived to [[Puerto Rico]] from the United States mainland and thus there were no buns to make and sell the company's flagship Whopper offering. Arenas opted for honoring the advertised opening date but using the much smaller regular hamburger buns locally available. The result was such a success that Burger King adopted it worldwide and called it the Whopper Jr.<ref name="Junior"/>

In 2020, as part of a global advertising campaign showing the company's commitment to dropping all artificial preservatives, Burger King ran the "Moldy Whopper" ad showing a Whopper decomposing and rotting over a period of 34 days. The Moldy Whopper campaign reached a level of awareness 50 percent higher than Burger King's ad in the 2019 Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/this-burger-chain-showed-mouldy-food-in-its-advertising-1.6466625|title=This burger chain showed mouldy food in its advertising|website=Cbc.ca|access-date=24 June 2022|archive-date=26 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220626124951/https://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/this-burger-chain-showed-mouldy-food-in-its-advertising-1.6466625|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ogilvy.com/work/moldy-whopper|title=The Moldy Whopper - Burger King &#124; Our Work|website=Ogilvy.com|access-date=24 June 2022|archive-date=23 May 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220523182432/https://www.ogilvy.com/work/moldy-whopper|url-status=live}}</ref>

As part of the 45th anniversary of the Whopper sandwich in 2002, Burger King introduced a grilled chicken version of the sandwich called the Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich along with a new Caesar salad sandwich topped with a Chicken Whopper patty.<ref>{{cite web |editor=Allen, Robin Lee |url=http://business.highbeam.com/409700/article-1G1-84019673/crown-jewels-new-marketing-product-rollouts-energize |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109013843/http://business.highbeam.com/409700/article-1G1-84019673/crown-jewels-new-marketing-product-rollouts-energize |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 November 2013 |title=Crown jewels: New marketing, product rollouts energize BK journey back to fast-food royalty |work=Nation's Restaurant News |date=18 March 2002 |type=subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|publisher=Burger King Corporation |url=http://www.bison.com/press_burgerking_05232002 |title=Burger King Sells 40 Millionth Chicken Whopper |date=23 May 2003 |type=subscription required |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528101232/http://www.bison.com/press_burgerking_05232002 |archive-date=28 May 2009 }}</ref><ref name=CT-Chicken>{{cite news |last=Rector |first=Sylvia |title=Chicken rules fast-food roost |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-11-06/entertainment/0211060202_1_menu-board-national-chicken-council-panera-bread |access-date=23 September 2011 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=6 November 2002 |agency=Knight Ridder/Tribune |archive-date=7 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007120202/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-11-06/entertainment/0211060202_1_menu-board-national-chicken-council-panera-bread |url-status=live }}</ref> The introduction of the Chicken Whopper represented the company's first move to extend the Whopper brand name beyond beef based sandwiches since the original Whopper's introduction in the 1950s.<ref name="AB-Carrols">{{cite web |title=Carrols: Chicken Whopper Is A Bust |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/eating-drinking-places/4274163-1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819184513/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/eating-drinking-places/4274163-1.html |archive-date=19 August 2007 |work=All Business |publisher=Dun & Bradstreet |access-date=23 September 2011 |date=March 2003}}</ref> The sandwiches featured a whole chicken breast filet, weighing either {{convert |4.7 |oz |g |abbr=on}} for the larger sandwich or a {{convert |3.1 |oz |g |abbr=on}} for the Jr., mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato on a sesame seed roll.<ref name="HC-Chick Whopper">{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Ken |title=Chicken sandwich grows up to be a Whopper |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/2002_3535763/chicken-sandwich-grows-up-to-be-a-whopper.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022042827/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/2002_3535763/chicken-sandwich-grows-up-to-be-a-whopper.html |archive-date=22 October 2012 |access-date=23 September 2011 |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |date=12 April 2002 |page=5}}</ref> A newly reformulated low fat mayonnaise was introduced in conjunction with the new sandwiches.<ref name="BW-Sales">{{cite news|last=Wahlgren |first=Eric |title=Burger Makers' Not-So-Meaty Prospects |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/apr2002/nf2002049_3504.htm |access-date=24 September 2011 |work=Business Week |date=9 April 2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130021015/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/apr2002/nf2002049_3504.htm |archive-date=30 November 2011 }}</ref> Along with the company's new [[BK Veggie]] sandwich, The Chicken Whopper Jr. version of the sandwich was lauded by the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI) as being one of the best nutritionally sound products sold by a fast food chain.

The Whopper has been at the center of several hoaxes and pranks from the company. In a 1998 [[April Fool's Day]] prank, Burger King took out a full page advertisement in several national publications such as ''[[USA Today]]'' advertising a new version of the sandwich called the "Left-Handed Whopper".

[[Crispin, Porter + Bogusky]], Burger King's advertising company of record from 2003 to 2011, produced several notable ads for the Whopper. In December 2008, Burger King purchased the rights to an advertising campaign that centered on a taste-test marketing campaign, dubbed "Whopper Virgins". The test claimed to target participants who were unaware of the existence of Burger King or McDonald's, and had never eaten a hamburger. Three remote areas of the world—Baan Khun Chang Kiean, [[Thailand]]; [[Kulusuk]], Greenland; and [[Budeşti]], Romania—were targeted. In the test, the "virgins" were asked to try both the McDonald's [[Big Mac]] and the Burger King Whopper, and give their preference, if any. According to the advertisements and accompanying mini-documentary, the Whopper was the most popular sandwich among the test subjects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whoppervirgins.com |title=WhopperVirgins.com |publisher=Burger King Brands |date=November 2008 |access-date=2019-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206044130/http://www.whoppervirgins.com/ |archive-date=2019-02-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Bryson |first=Emily York |url=http://adage.com/article?article_id=133063 |work=Advertising Age |title=WhopperVirgins.com |access-date=15 November 2013 |date=8 December 2008 |archive-date=11 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211041554/http://adage.com/article?article_id=133063 |url-status=live }}</ref> A social media based promotion from Crispin Porter + Bogusky in 2009 gave a free Whopper coupon for every 10 friends on [[Facebook]] a user would drop.

=== Controversies ===
Several of CP+B's advertising programs for Burger King, including ones for the Whopper, drew criticism from groups for perceived cultural insensitivity or misogynistic themes within them. In May 2006, in an American promotion of the Texas Double Whopper, Burger King released a campaign called the "Manthem" which parodies [[Helen Reddy]]'s "[[I Am Woman]]". It depicts a man and his girlfriend at a fancy restaurant. Disappointed by the meager portions he is served, the man bursts into song, expressing his desire for a Texas Double Whopper, in place of what he deems "chick food." As he walks out of the restaurant, he is joined by a chorus of men who rebel by not only eating Texas Double Whoppers, but also [[going commando|go commando]], lift a [[minivan]] over the side of an [[overpass]], and unfurl a banner which says "Eat This Meat." This has been the source of some controversy, as the commercial has been described as demeaning to male vegetarians/vegans, as well as [[misogyny|misogynistic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adjab.com/2006/05/08/ads-we-love-burger-kings-manthem/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619194225/http://www.adjab.com/2006/05/08/ads-we-love-burger-kings-manthem/ |archive-date=19 June 2006 |title=Ads We Love: Burger King's "Manthem" |first=Ben |last=Popken |publisher=AdJab.com |date=8 May 2006 |access-date=27 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/commercials/i-am-man-hear-me-roar-when-my-heart-explodes-177354.php |title=I Am Man, Hear Me Roar...

Another problematic CP+B advertising program was for the 2009 Texican Whopper that featured commercial known as "The Little Mexican". The Texican Whopper was a limited-time-only version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a [[lucha libre]] wrestler.<ref name="AdAge-Texican">{{cite web |last=Parekh |first=Rupal |title=BK to Revise Ad After Complaints From Mexican Official |url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/burger-king-revise-ad-complaints-mexican-official/135989/ |work=AdAge |access-date=12 November 2013 |date=14 April 2009 |archive-date=7 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107014449/http://adage.com/article/global-news/burger-king-revise-ad-complaints-mexican-official/135989/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans. Additionally, the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape that appeared to be a [[Mexican flag]], a violation of Mexican [[Law on the National Arms, Flag, and Anthem (Mexico)|laws governing the usage]] of its national banner.<ref name="FN-Texican">{{cite web |title=Burger King 'Little Mexican' Ad Slammed in Spain |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/04/14/burger-king-little-mexican-ad-slammed-in-spain/ |work=Fox News |publisher=Fox News |access-date=12 November 2013 |date=14 April 2009 |agency=SkyNews |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208204141/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/04/14/burger-king-little-mexican-ad-slammed-in-spain/ |archive-date=2013-12-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Burger King eventually pulled the ad and issued an apology to the Mexican government.

On April 12, 2017, Burger King released a commercial entitled ''Connected Whopper'', in which a store employee says that while he could not explain a Whopper in 15 seconds, he had discovered a different way to do so, after which he states "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?". The dialogue was designed to trigger [[Google Voice Search|voice searches]] on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices and [[Google Home]] [[smart speaker]]s configured to automatically respond to the phrase "OK Google".<ref name="variety-voicesearch"/><ref name="FinTim">{{cite news|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Tim|title=Burger King activates a Google Home controversy|url=https://www.ft.com/content/480e5ba6-202b-11e7-a454-ab04428977f9 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221210/https://www.ft.com/content/480e5ba6-202b-11e7-a454-ab04428977f9 |archive-date=2022-12-10 |url-access=subscription|access-date=April 26, 2017|publisher=Financial Times|date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>  The specific query caused the device to read out a 43 word block of text from [[English Wikipedia|Wikipedia]]'s article on the Whopper.

{{main|BK Whopper Bar}}

The '''BK Whopper Bar''' is limited service concept created by Burger King in 2009.<ref name="wb-nyt">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/business/29whopper.html |title=A Half-Century Old, the Whopper to Get a Younger Image |last=Grynbaum |first=Michael |date=29 March 2009 |work=The New York Times |access-date=10 October 2009 |location=New York |archive-date=3 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203021105/https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/business/29whopper.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Whopper Bars are smaller footprint, specialized stores with a menu limited to the company's Whopper, [[TenderCrisp|crispy chicken sandwich]] and [[BK grilled chicken sandwiches|grilled chicken sandwich]] sandwiches; drinks; and desserts.<ref name="bk-wb menu">{{cite web|url=http://www.bkwhopperbar.com/en-us/universal-citywalk/menu.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009004615/http://www.bkwhopperbar.com/en-us/universal-citywalk/menu.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 9 October 2009 |title=Whopper Bar menu |publisher=Burger King Brands |access-date=10 October 2009 }}</ref> The menu features higher-end ingredients and variants not sold in the normal Burger King locations. The concept is similar to the [[McCafé]] concept from rival [[McDonald's]], and like the McCafé locations they are designed to go into airports, casinos, and other areas with limited amounts of space.<ref name="wb-tfc">{{cite web |url=http://www.foodchannel.com/stories/288-burger-king-unveils-whopper-bar/ |title=Burger King Unveils Whopper Bar |first=Lindsey |last=Klingele |work=The Food Channel |publisher=Glam Networks, LLC |date=3 April 2009 |access-date=10 October 2009 |archive-date=3 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603094840/http://www.foodchannel.com/stories/288-burger-king-unveils-whopper-bar |url-status=live }}</ref>

The menu at the Whopper Bar features as many as 10 variants on the Whopper, including the Western Whopper, the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper. Additionally, a customization section allows the customer to have a personalized Whopper made with ingredients such as jalapeño peppers, steak sauce or blue cheese. The open station differs from the company's usual kitchen model in that it is in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back-end of the store. The intent of the design is to add a sense of showmanship to the concept.<ref name="WSJ-Whopper Bar">{{cite news |last=Adamy |first=Janet |title=Burger King Whopper To Be Feted |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB120672457122272165 |access-date=6 November 2013 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=29 March 2008 |type=subscription required |archive-date=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113080859/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB120672457122272165 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Additionally, the company sells beer at the Whopper Bar locations, including [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], [[Bud Light]], and [[Miller Lite]] in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.<ref name="bk-beer">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2010-01-21-burger-king-beer_N.htm |title=Burger King plans beer-selling Whopper Bar in South Beach |last=Horovitz |first=Bruce |date=22 January 2009 |work=USA Today |access-date=23 January 2010 |location=Miami, Florida |archive-date=25 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125013030/http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2010-01-21-burger-king-beer_N.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="bnet-beer">{{cite web |url=http://www.bnet.com/blog/food/burger-king-says-have-it-your-way-beer-with-that-whopper-and-fries/1287 |title=Burger King Says "Have It Your Way:" Beer With That Whopper and Fries? |last=Phillips |first=David |date=25 January 2010 |publisher=BNet.com |access-date=8 February 2010 |archive-date=15 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315064338/http://www.bnet.com/blog/food/burger-king-says-have-it-your-way-beer-with-that-whopper-and-fries/1287 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="qsrweb-beer">{{cite web|url=http://www.qsrweb.com/article/96407/New-Burger-King-Whopper-Bar-to-serve-beer |title=New BK Whopper Bar to sell beer |last=Hoyland |first=Christa |date=22 January 2010 |publisher=QSRWeb.com |access-date=22 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715135532/http://www.qsrweb.com/article/96407/New-Burger-King-Whopper-Bar-to-serve-beer |archive-date=15 July 2011 }}</ref>

== Naming and trademarks ==
When Burger King expanded into the [[San Antonio]] area, it was prevented from utilizing the name Whopper in its local advertising and stores due to a prior state-registered service mark owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger.<ref name="barkoff">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVmD3FAG3zgC&q=Fundamentals+of+Franchising |title=Fundamentals of Franchising |first=Rupert M. |last=Barkoff |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |date=25 January 2005 |isbn=1-59031-409-3 |page=23 |access-date=5 December 2020 |archive-date=9 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230409180032/https://books.google.com/books?id=eVmD3FAG3zgC&q=Fundamentals+of+Franchising |url-status=live }}</ref> The chain, owned by Frank and Barbara Bates, prevented the company from using the name in [[Bexar County]] for several years until Mrs. Bates, who became the CEO of Whopper Burger after the death of her husband in 1983, retired and sold the chain with its related trademarks to then-corporate parent Pillsbury in the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite press release|title=San Antonio: A Legacy Steeped in History, A Culture Rich in Diversity |publisher=[[United States General Services Administration]] |date=February 2003 |quote=San Antonio is the original birthplace of the ‘whopper burger.’ Because of copyright laws, Burger King was unable to open restaurants in San Antonio until ‘Whopper Burger’ was bought out by the Pillsbury Company and the remainder of the restaurants closed down or were transformed into Burger Kings.}}</ref><ref name="SAEN-Trademark">{{cite news |last=Bivins |first=Ralph |title=Burger King promises store by year-end |url=http://blog.mysanantonio.com/vault/2011/06/whopper-burger-vs-burger-king/ |page=7C |access-date=6 November 2013 |newspaper=San Antonio Express-News |date=5 October 1985 |archive-date=9 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109025207/http://blog.mysanantonio.com/vault/2011/06/whopper-burger-vs-burger-king/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>
